Webill Project: KIC's Class Assignment
------------------------------
Cleanergy owns a power distribution grid that delivers electricity to consumers in Tatoeba city, Japan. On the consumer’s premises, Cleanergy installs an electricity meter marked with a QR-code that uniquely identifies the meter. One of the Cleanergy staffs monthly visits the consumer’s facility to get the reading of the meter and accordingly issue the electricity bill on a paper.

Cleanergy plans to introduce a new way for collecting the readings of the electricity meters necessary for generating the bills of its customers. A customer who agrees to use the new method will be asked to type in the reading and upload a photo of the electricity meter installed on their premises once a month to a web application (WeBill). The picture should include the QR-code of the meter in addition to the reading. Upon verifying the identity and interpretation of the meter, WeBill issues the bill and sends it to the email address of the customer.

Customers register in the new project by sending their information to Cleanergy via a separate system for registration. Participating customers will get their credentials (to use WeBill) from the registration system. A registered user logs in to WeBill using the credentials obtained from the registration system.

WeBill introduces an interface to the consumer to upload a photo of the electricity meter within a particular window of time every month. Other interfaces for editing profile, viewing bills, and so on.
